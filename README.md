This repository has some example code to show what can be done with
the RSP. No warranty is given with any of this code and it is
provided as is.

play_sdr has been updated to use the new API functions and added support
for RSP1 and RSP2. Also it now supports both 8 and 16 bit output.

sdrplay_api_example.c has been added as an example - it's for the new
service based API (3.0)
